# Parkinson's Disease Psychosis resting fMRI Analyses
Scripts for the paper on resting fMRI in PD Psychosis

This repository contains code to analyse resting state fMRI data from patients with Parkinson's Disease Psychosis and healthy control subjects, as reported by Montagnese et al,. Please cite the paper and any related ones listed below if you find the code helpful for your work. 

The APARC500 atlas for used throughout this work. The APARC500 is an atlas developed by [Romero-Garcia et al., (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.086) and is based on a subdivision of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006). The APARC500 comprises of 308 cortical ROIs that are spatially contiguous and of approximately equal size (∼5mm) generated by using a backtracking algorithm described in detail in the original publication.

The Yeo network mapping was performed by Jakob Seidlitz as part of the paper [Váša et al, Cereb Cortex. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx249). The von Economo class mapping was performed by Konrad Wagstyl and Dr Kirstie Whitaker as part of the paper [Whitaker and Vértes, PNAS 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/32/9105).
